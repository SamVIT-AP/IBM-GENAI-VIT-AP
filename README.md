Story generator-
My project is an AI-powered story generator that helps users create short, creative stories from simple prompts. Built using Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers, the application takes a user’s input (like “A robot discovers human emotions”) and generates a unique story using a pre-trained language model (GPT-Neo). The tool runs in Google Colab and is accessible via a public link using ngrok, making creative writing fun, fast, and accessible without needing any coding or setup.
